If you have any questions or want to chat about your job hunt, feel free to email me at jesse@codeunion.io! :)\n\nSome General Rules for (Technical) Interviews\n\nBe Humble\nFirst, the mindset: humility.  This is always true, but especially true when you're talking about your first job in a new field, entry-level or otherwise. You are not entitled to anything above and beyond common courtesy and basic respect for your time and person \u2014 not an offer, not a nice interviewer, not fair questions, not anything.\n\nYou think coding on a whiteboard is stupid?  So do I, but deal with it.  You think questions about linked lists are stupid?  You're only allowed to say that if you can articulate when they're the right data structure to use and when they're not.  But even if you can, what's the upside in getting indignant?\n\nPreempt Expectations\nYou're aspiring to be an entry-level Rails engineer.  Maybe you went through a coding bootcamp.  The cards are stacked against you, both because of your relative inexperience and because interviewers will already believe things about you, e.g., \"They don't really know how to program, they only know how Rails works\", \"They might be able to cobble together a Rails application, but they don't really understand the fundamentals\", \"Anyone who went through a coding bootcamp is just looking for a shortcut to a well-paying job.  They don't actually want to put in the effort.\"\n\nThese thoughts might strike you as unfair.  They might even make you angry.  Nevertheless, those thoughts are there and you have to filter everything you say and do through two lenses: (1) am I taking every opportunity to preempt these thoughts? and (2) am I unintentionally reinforcing these thoughts?\n\nMaintain Momentum and Avoid \"No\"\nDo everything you can to keep the process moving forward before, during, after the interview.  This means doing things like...\n1. Arriving 30-ish minutes early to the location in case there are logistical \"unknown unknowns,\" e.g., you can't find the front desk, your interviewer gave you bad directions and you find yourself walking in circles, etc.\n2. Bringing along multiple paper copies of your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 (yes, paper).  If someone asks, \"Do you have a copy of your r\u00e9sum\u00e9?\" you don't want to say, \"No, sorry, I didn't print it out.\", \"No, sorry, I emailed it to so-and-so.\", or \"No, sorry, I only brought one copy and already gave it to someone.\"\n3. Pens.  Pencils.  Blank pieces of paper (lots).  Markers.  Does the interview room have a whiteboard but no whiteboard markers?  Oops, it's the interviewer's fault, but you can still control the situation with a little preparation.  This is better than wasting 10 minutes while the interviewer goes looking for some.\n4. Bring your laptop.  It should be fully charged, but bring a power adapter regardless. Your laptop should set up to start coding immediately and you should verify that everything is working.  Can you run code?  Can you run Rails?  Do it the night before.\n5. Whiteboards.  There's a chance you'll be using them. Writing on a whiteboard isn't as easy as you might think, so do some practice runs.  For example, you have to be sensitive to whether the way you're positioning your body is obscuring the interview's view of what you're writing.  You also don't want to be a \"whiteboard talker\" and will have to learn how to write, talk, and look at your interviewer at the same time.  These are Presentation Skills 101\u2122, honestly, but they still requires practice.\n6. Talk.  Speak.  Ramble.  Use whatever words come to mind, even if you're afraid they'll make you sound stupid.  If you say 20 things in the span of 10 minutes and 5 are smart, a good interviewer will hone in on those.  If you say 2 things in the span of 10 minutes and only one is smart, not only will the interviewer be frustrated with the rhythm of the interview but they'll have very little to hone in on.  \"I can't tell.\" and \"This person is dangerously incompetent.\" have the same outcome for you: no offer.\n\nMemorize and Practice Essential Patterns\nEvery (modern) language shares three core flow control constructs: iteration, branching, and subroutines (i.e., functions & methods).  Know the patterns for these things inside and out.  You should also know your language's core data types (booleans, integers, floats, strings, arrays, hashes, etc.) and, if your language supports them, objects and classes.\n\nNo, you don't need to memorize every last syntactical detail of Ruby or JavaScript or whatever else, but if you can't remember how to write a [code]for[/code] loop in JavaScript and have to look it up, it will slow down the interview and send a signal that you don't know what you're doing, don't write code enough to be comfortable with these patterns, or didn't know enough to prepare.\n\nRuby-Specific Questions\nThis will be more laundry list style.  Everything above applies here, obviously, so I'm not doing to say things like \"You should be able to define and call a methods.\"  See Memorize and Practice Essential Patterns above.\n\nHere's an example question, in three parts.\n\n[code ruby]\n# 1. Implement your own Enumerable#map\ndef map(array, &block)\nend\n\n# 2. Implement your own Enumerable#inject\ndef inject(initial, array, &block)\nend\n\n# 3. Now, re-implement your map method\n# as a single call to (your) inject\n[/code]\n\n1. Have a consistent, idiomatic style.  I like GitHub's Ruby Style Guide [ https://github.com/styleguide/ruby ].  Some things are non-negotiable and if you don't do them it will send a funny signal (e.g., Ruby code is always always always indented with two spaces per indentation level \u2014 not tabs, not 4 spaces, but 2 spaces).  Other things are more negotiable, but it's nice to see candidates who care that their code is easy for other people to read.\n2. Know how to read and navigation the documentation at http://ruby-doc.org/.\n3. Ruby has many ways to iterate.  Know them.  [code]while ... do ... end [/code], [code]enum.each { |...| ... }[/code], Integer#upto [ http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Integer.html#method-i-upto ], Integer#downto [ http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Integer.html#method-i-upto ], and Integer#times [ http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Integer.html#method-i-times ] are often the most direct way of expressing the kind of loop you want to do.  Obviously [code]each[/code] is the most important.\n4. Blocks.  Know how to identify them using both the [code]{ |a,b,c| ...}[/code] syntax and the [code]do |a,b,c| ... end[/code] syntax.  Know how to write methods that accept blocks as arguments using both the [code]yield[/style] syntax and [code]&block / block.call[/code] syntax.\n5. Be comfortable with core Enumerable types, how to iterate over them, and when it is appropriate to use each one. That means being comfortable with [code]Array[/code], [code]Hash[/code], and [code]Range[/code] at a minimum.  Bonus points for using [code]Set[/code] where appropriate.\n6. Enumerable methods.  At a bare minimum you should know how to use, implement, and explain the workings of Enumerable#each_with_index [ http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Enumerable.html#method-i-each_with_index ], Enumerable#inject [ http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Enumerable.html#method-i-inject ], Enumerable#map [ http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Enumerable.html#method-i-map ], and Enumerable#select [ http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Enumerable.html#method-i-select ].  You should be able to spot code that can be refactored using these methods. If you want to go deeper, understand how to implement [code]map[/code] and [code]select[/code] using [code]inject[/code].\n7. Classes and objects.  Be able to define them.  Understand how instance variables work.  Understand why class variables in Ruby, i.e., [code]@@class_variable[/code], are almost never what you want. Understand what [code]attr_read[/code], [code]attr_writer[/code], and [code]attr_accessor[/code] do.  Better yet: be able to implement your own versions of each.  Understand SOLID (object-oriented design) [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design) ] and how it applies to Ruby code. The Law Of Demeter [ http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LawOfDemeter ] is your friend.\n\n\nGeneral Web and Rails-Specific Questions\n\nMostly you have to understand what's \"really happening.\"  I'm a big fan of giving candidates a pre-built Rails application with bugs and other issues and asking them to fix the problems.\n\n1. Understand the HTTP request/response cycle.  Do you know what an HTTP request looks like?  It's all human-readable and in plain text, so the answer to this is very concrete.  Have you even seen a raw HTTP request before?\n2. Understand the difference between \"the internet\" and \"the web\"\n3. Be able to answer the ol' clich\u00e9: \"Tell me what happens when you type http://codeunion.io into your browser's URL bar and press enter.\"\n4. ActiveRecord: know how it relates to SQL and how to use it idiomatically.  See jfarmer/theory_of_learning.md [ https://gist.github.com/jfarmer/d29bb09caa024e3b349f ] for an overview of ActiveRecord.  Don't be sloppy with validations and associations, either.\n5. Schema design: know how to design a properly normalized database schema and how to identify whether a database schema is well-designed or not.\n6. Form helpers and nested forms.  They kind of suck, but they're everywhere in Rails-land.\n7. Know common bugs like \"What is the n+1 selects issue? [ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/97197/what-is-the-n1-selects-issue ]\"  Avoid them and know how to identify and verify them when they're present.\n8. Know where all the parts of a Rails application live.  What goes where and why?\n9. Know what aspects of Rails are there for conventional or historical reasons, especially if they're part of the \"Rails magic,\" e.g., auto-pluralizing model names to derive the underlying database table name.\n\nAs a potential entry-level engineer, you are ignorant, whether you know it or not.  This means anyone hiring you knows they're taking on the responsibility of teaching you a bunch of stuff.\n\nBetween someone who knows Rails inside and out but doesn't know what's \"really happening\" and someone who is shaky with the details of Rails but understands what's happening under the hood, an employer will prefer the latter.  Why?  The assumption will be that it's easier to teach the latter person Rails than it is to teach the former person the fundamentals.\n\nHope that helps!", "upvoteCount": 72, "url": "https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-prepare-for-an-entry-level-Ruby-on-Rails-developer-interview-What-questions-should-I-expect?top_ans=5853236"}], "answerCount": 8, "author": {"@type": "Person", "agentInteractionStatistic": {"@type": "InteractionCounter", "interactionType": "http://schema.org/ReplyAction", "userInteractionCount": 238}, "image": "https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-18615613-100-stigxqcyeunwvtmxbllytncnbobugcom.jpeg", "interactionStatistic": {"@type": "InteractionCounter", "interactionType": "http://schema.org/FollowAction", "userInteractionCount": 205}, "name": "Faisal Hassan", "url": "https://www.quora.com/profile/Faisal-Hassan-4"}, "dateCreated": "2014-06-25T15:54:20.669334+00:00", "dateModified": "2024-08-16T22:07:36.146048+00:00", "hasPart": {"@type": "WebPageElement", "cssSelector": ".content-monetization-wall", "isAccessibleForFree": "False"}, "isAccessibleForFree": "False", "name": "How do I prepare for an entry level Ruby on Rails developer interview?

I agree with Anton Melnik that if you take this on you will learn more about Ruby and Rails than most any other position.\n\nBackground: About 4.5 years ago I moved to Silicon Valley to take a position at a tiny startup. That particular startup was a disaster in the making, so much so that I left after 11 months (one month shy of the one year option vest) because they started lying to potential investors and I felt the stock would be worthless anyway. (I was right.)\n\nI took a position with a larger startup that was night and day different. The staff was competent and the most welcoming of any job I\u2019ve ever had in my 35+ year career. When I attended meetings they ASKED for my opinion, even though I barely knew what was going on, and they gave me a retroactive signing bonus because they announced a bonus for everyone my third day and I had *just* missed the cutoff.\n\nHowever, they had a huge (25,000+ lines of Ruby, HTML, Javascript, etc.) Rails 2, Ruby 1.8.7 application that completely orchestrated their cloud-based service. The original developers were gone, new code had only been pushed out once in the previous year (six months before I arrived) and that had been a disaster.\n\nThe application had tests, but they didn\u2019t run, depended on a particular set of data (that couldn\u2019t be found) and were bad tests to start with. (Store 5 into database. Read database. Did we get a 5?)\n\nThey had attempted to start complete re-writes, but those attempts had just sputtered out as they worked to keep things running.\n\nMy first step was to get the application running in development mode and see if we could solve some of their immediate issues. I always watch the Rails log while working on a Rails application and I saw huge numbers of database requests, many looking almost identical. This screams out as an \u201cN+1\u201d issue (look it up).\n\nMy first week at the job I started speeding up the page loads by more than a factor of 4 simply by adding \u201cincludes\u201d clauses to many of the ActiveRecord retrievals.\n\nGetting the updated application approved for distribution took almost a month, they were so leary. We ran it in a test environment, pounding it hard, then slowly rolled it out with no issues.\n\nIn the mean time, I set up an attack plan to get a Rails 2/Ruby 1.8.7 application refactored up to Rails 4/Ruby 2.?. (Total re-writes rarely succeed, especially when the current code is necessary for continuing operations.)\n\nHere is what I came up with.\n\n * First, don\u2019t even *attempt* to jump directly to current versions. The changes are too massive and you won\u2019t be able to keep the application running in the mean time.\n * Upgrade just *one* thing at a time. Start with upgrading Ruby from 1.8.7 to version 1.9.3 (appropriate for Rails 3). Next work on Rails 2 -%3E Rails 3. Then upgrade Ruby, then Rails, etc.\n * Check out newrelic/rails3_upgrade [ https://github.com/newrelic/rails3_upgrade ]. It\u2019s a gem that lets you *switch* Rails versions using environment variables, and keep both sets of configurations.\n * I used RVM to manage Ruby and Gemsets and wrote a couple of small scripts to swap my .ruby-version and .ruby-gemset files depending on which environment I was running/testing.\n * I got rid of all the old tests. They were worthless. Keep yours if they work, but don\u2019t spend much time on keeping them running unless they are \u201cbehavior\u201d tests (tests that just check results and not tests that test particular implementation.\n * I started writing *new*, behavior based tests using an old version of Rspec that would run under Rails 2/3.\n * Set up your tests so that they execute in ALL of your currently supported environments. I.E., if you still run Rails 2 in production, ALL tests must pass in Rails 2 mode. However, if you\u2019re working on the Rails 2 to Rails 3 step, they must also pass in that mode. At one point I had 3 environments (Rails 2/Ruby 1.8.7, Rails 2/Ruby 1.9.3, Rails 3/Ruby 1.93). The same tests passed in all three environments.\nAs I worked on this project I also had to fix a backlog of bugs and small enhancement requests. I also had to convince them we could safely deploy.\n\nI did this by strictly following \u201cbest practices\u201d. Whenever I worked on a bug I would start by writing a (failing) test that *confirmed* the bug. I would post an update to the bug report about the new failing test. Then I would fix the bug until the test passed and update the ticket.\n\nOn some occasions as the quantity of tests increased I would fix a bug and get it\u2019s test to pass only to have one or more other tests fail. I would post THAT status to the ticket, explain what I had missed in my original fix, refactor until all tests passed and then post THAT status. (When another tests fails, that should be considered a HUGE win and validation of your previous tests. One of them just saved you!)\n\nAfter a month of pounding on the new code, they finally held their breaths and allowed it to be deployed. NO issues. By the time the company closed down (unrelated issues) I could deploy on demand. I *never* took down production.\n\nIn the mean time, I attacked models and then controllers, wrapping deprecated Rails 2 code and new Rails 3 code in if/then blocks. (if RAILS-2 %3Cold code%3E else %3Cnew code%3E).\n\nHere are some issues I remember:\n\n * Ruby upgrade from 1.8.7 to 1.93 was fairly easy. I seem to remember some changes to case/when statements that required some updates. Finding a compatible set of gems was tougher, but I finally managed to build two Gemfiles (swapped when environments were changed) that worked.\n * Rails 2 to Rails 3 will be your *largest* step, especially if you re-write all ActiveRecord requests to the newer ActiveRecord Query style of current Rails. I updated every one, wrapping them in my environment if/else blocks.\n * Biggest issue I found was with ERB templates. One of the changes from Rails 2 to Rails 3 was in the form_for helper. In Rails 2 it did not include an equals sign (\u201c=\u201d) but in Rails 3 that\u2019s required. Unfortunately, ERB will evaluate *both* the if and the else clauses, so ERB reported an error in my templates for the Rails 3 \u201c=\u201d signs, even though that code would never have been executed in Rails 2 mode. That bug does NOT exist in the HAML renderer that work in Rails 2, so I simply upgraded those ERB templated to HAML (which I prefer anyway)\nDepending on the size of the application and how busy you are also fixing bugs and making enhancements to the current running version, this project could take years, so don\u2019t underestimate it (or allow your new employer to underestimate it!).\n\nI had great support from that company and I\u2019d work with those people again in an instant. (We even had a great product that unfortunately was too early for the market and the company couldn\u2019t afford the expense necessary to keep running until the product would be profitable.)\n\nHope that helps with your (difficult) decision.", "upvoteCount": 3, "url": "https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-prepare-for-an-entry-level-Ruby-on-Rails-developer-interview-What-questions-should-I-expect?top_ans=61072889"}, {"@type": "Answer", "author": {"@type": "Person", "agentInteractionStatistic": {"@type": "InteractionCounter", "interactionType": "http://schema.org/ReplyAction", "userInteractionCount": 211}, "description": "Technologist and entrepreneur", "image": "https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-66117686-100-bavpmgphllvkuafqnydjjyqmjtlnjfwd.jpeg", "interactionStatistic": {"@type": "InteractionCounter", "interactionType": "http://schema.org/FollowAction", "userInteractionCount": 261}, "name": "Sean Cosentino", "url": "https://www.quora.com/profile/Sean-Cosentino"}, "dateCreated": "2015-09-09T15:40:15.457153+00:00", "text": "There is a really great Interview Question board for Programmers.

But this is either a brilliant trick question or, I suspect, a really sloppy spec. And dealing with ill-conceived requests is something a senior developer does quite often.\n\nAlthough it's labeled a \"Btree\", this is just a binary tree and not the more general B-tree structure. (I didn't know this off the top of my head but it only took a few seconds to look it up.)\n\nThe problem is prompting us to use recursion, but there's something a bit funny about what they're asking, so let's google \"binary tree depth\" and get our terms straight:\n\nBinary Trees [ http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Trees/trees.html ] (first search result)\n * The topmost node in the tree is called the root.\n * The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node.\n * The height of a node is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf.\nSo now I'm pretty sure they're asking me to calculate the depth of a node when they actually mean the height. I can calculate the height of a given node by recursively calculating the height of its children and adding 1 to the larger height (or either if they're the same).\n\n[code ruby]\nclass Node\n  attr_accessor :lnode, :rnode\n \n  def height\n    return 0 unless lnode || rnode # leaf node height is 0\n    [lnode, rnode].compact.map(&:height).max + 1 # otherwise add 1 to max of child nodes' heights\n  end\nend\n[/code]\n\n\nThis happens all the time: smart people like to figure out how to solve their own problem, and then they just need a developer to implement the solution they're describing. \"What is the problem we're trying to solve?\" I often find myself asking. That might allow me to realize they're actually asking for something different and build a better solution for them.\n\nSince I'm told to implement the depth method, I could notice that there's no reference to the parent node nor the root node. So I could just assume the node I'm given is always the root and write this:\n\n[code ruby]\ndef depth\n  0\nend\n[/code]\n\nAnother way to implement a spec that doesn't really make sense is to just follow the instructions very literally. It's basically sarcastic coding.\n\n[code]\n# Implement the depth method so that it returns the larger depth of lnode or rnode\n[/code]\n\nAgain, if I assume this is the root node then the children, if they exist, have a depth of 1. (Remember, their depth is just the distance from the root, it's height which depends on their subtrees.)\n\n[code ruby]\ndef depth\n  lnode || rnode ? 1 : nil\nend\n[/code]\n\nThis is me returning the actual depth property of the children from the depth() method. But I could also interpret this as returning the larger the value that lnode or rnode return from their depth() method.\n\n[code ruby]\ndef depth\n  0\nend\n[/code]\n\nThis is fine. 0 is a reasonable base case for many recursive algorithms, and the instructions neglect to mention that I need to add 1 to the greater of the child nodes' values (as we did when calculating height). So whatever the children return just gets passed up the chain. A random number would also be valid if we're assuming \"the larger depth of lnode or rnode\" just means whatever their depth() method returns.\n\nNow we could also look at the request and decide to actually implement a method that returns the actual depth of the node. Above we assumed the node is the root, but since this is ruby we can get sneaky and figure out if there's a parent node above the node we're given.\n\n[code ruby]\ndef parent\n  ObjectSpace.each_object(Node) do |node|\n    return node if [node.lnode, node.rnode].include? self\n  end\n  nil\nend\n[/code]\n\nNow I'd never use ObjectSpace in production, but I also probably wouldn't implement a binary tree from scratch. So even though the node doesn't have a parent attribute, we can concoct a method that does the same thing and then it's pretty simple to figure out the depth (and the root if you like).\n\n[code ruby]\nclass Node\n  attr_accessor :lnode, :rnode\n\n  def depth\n    parent ? parent.depth + 1 : 0\n  end\n\n  def parent\n    ObjectSpace.each_object(Node) do |node|\n      return node if [node.lnode, node.rnode].include? self\n    end\n    nil\n  end\n\n  def root\n    parent ? parent.root : self\n  end\nend\n[/code]\n\nIf I wanted to be really sarcastic I could rename my method above actual_depth() and then implement a depth() method that returns the larger of the actual depths of the children. So that method just returns the depth of the children or nil.\n\n[code ruby]\ndef depth\n  ldepth = lnode && lnode.actual_depth\n  rdepth = rnode && rnode.actual_depth\n  [ldepth, rdepth].compact.max\n  # technically it says \"larger\" not \"max\" so i'm tempted to return nil if they're equal ;)\nend\n[/code]\n\nAnd you could produce the same result this way:\n\n[code ruby]\ndef depth\n  lnode || rnode ? actual_depth + 1 : nil\nend\n[/code]\n\nIf I were asked this question in an interview I guess I'd try to figure out whether they actually wanted me to implement height, or implement depth properly. If that didn't get me anywhere I'd show them my hardcoded 0 implementation and hope they appreciate how I can make a case for it. I think all of those demonstrate the thought process a senior developer should have (or really a developer at any level).\n\nAnd if they insisted I implement the spec as given I could probably pass that test, but I doubt I'd be interested in taking the job. I've written enough sarcastic code in my career already.", "upvoteCount": 24, "url": "https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-prepare-for-an-entry-level-Ruby-on-Rails-developer-interview-What-questions-should-I-expect?top_ans=15968340"}, {"@type": "Answer", "author": {"@type": "Person", "agentInteractionStatistic": {"@type": "InteractionCounter", "interactionType": "http://schema.org/ReplyAction", "userInteractionCount": 3}, "description": "web developer at Prey (2013-present)", "hasOccupation": {"@type": "Role", "roleName": "web developer", "startDate": "2013"}, "image": "https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-4171175-100-OXy5zkvgiVt9bjzbsUQCC5JSbJeESdsj.jpeg", "interactionStatistic": {"@type": "InteractionCounter", "interactionType": "http://schema.org/FollowAction", "userInteractionCount": 41}, "name": "Miguel Michelson", "url": "https://www.quora.com/profile/Miguel-Michelson", "worksFor": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Prey"}}, "dateCreated": "2018-11-07T13:31:19.141127+00:00", "parentItem": {"@type": "Comment", "text": "How can I interview Ruby on Rails developers?", "url": "https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-interview-Ruby-on-Rails-developers"}, "text": "It the depends on the role.

Accept that progress never ends and learning must become part of your working life.\n2. Choose a new paradigm to learn and then become accustomed to, in order to grow your overall skill with the language and tool agnostic parts of the practice of writing software.\n3. Read - A LOT\n4. Do things, do not fear failure.  The only thing to fear is inaction.\n5. Embrace \"Best Practice\" in terms of Agile Process, TDD, Pair Programming and don't just do so blindly, learn why these things are positive, and eventually learn when it is ok to bend or even break the rules, something that can only come with experience.\nI went on to learn and use professionally, Python, Ruby and Clojure, as well as deepening and widening my understanding of JavaScript.  The exposure to other ideas and the understanding this brought me with regard to how languages work, how software works and how to write code / applications / systems that are genuinely able to scale was over time the path to seniority and eventually management.  Along my journey I also came to a deeper understanding of a lot of theory, and while I don't recommend focusing too much attention here, it is a good thing to know how Hash Tables work, or a bit about Set Theory - ymmv.\n\nThere is one other really important thing to take on board:\n\nThere are always going to be people that are better than you at [programming language X], or know more about [database Y] - do not be afraid of them, do not be threatened by them.  Learn from them - I guarantee that if they are genuinely people from whom you can learn, they will learn from you as well.  No one can know everything.\n\nI wish you luck, in the end my continued happiness in my work and success in reaching my personal goals re career development have come down to the basic tenet \"never stop learning, never stop exploring\"; I am sure that you will find it just as useful a way of looking at the Software Engineering world as I have.\n\nP.S. Make sure you learn GO, Erlang / Elixir and / or Haskell at some point, even if you never __use__ them - there is so much to gain from them alongside your more mainstream languages.", "upvoteCount": 8, "url": "https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-prepare-for-an-entry-level-Ruby-on-Rails-developer-interview-What-questions-should-I-expect?top_ans=15772333"}, {"@type": "Answer", "author": {"@type": "Person", "agentInteractionStatistic": {"@type": "InteractionCounter", "interactionType": "http://schema.org/ReplyAction", "userInteractionCount": 95}, "description": "Founder & Trainer at DCT Academy (2015-present)", "hasOccupation": {"@type": "Role", "roleName": "Founder & Trainer", "startDate": "2015"}, "image": "https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-24084221-100-gsafeqegedxorrgtdrouigikdnqxcozu.jpeg", "interactionStatistic": {"@type": "InteractionCounter", "interactionType": "http://schema.org/FollowAction", "userInteractionCount": 144}, "name": "Aniruddha Sg", "url": "https://www.quora.com/profile/Aniruddha-Sg", "worksFor": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "DCT Academy"}}, "dateCreated": "2016-09-02T14:33:27.082342+00:00", "dateModified": "2016-09-03T01:41:05.565620+00:00", "parentItem": {"@type": "Comment", "text": "What skills are required by a junior ruby on rails developer in order to get a job?", "url": "https://www.quora.com/What-skills-are-required-by-a-junior-ruby-on-rails-developer-in-order-to-get-a-job"}, "text": "You are expected to be familiar with the following topics\n\n1.

To put it in the most direct way possible, No matter how brilliant you are, if you cannot showcase it, you will not be selected.\n\nThere are many brilliant people who fail at getting their dream job just because they do not know how to approach a specific question. Once you know how to approach these questions, the next thing that you have to focus on is how you should behave during the interview.\n\nKeep these pointers in mind during your interview -\n\n * Don\u2019t rush to answer the questions and first figure out what exactly the question is asking you to solve.\n * Maintain eye contact with the interviews and try to avoid fidgeting as much as possible as it gives an impression that you are unprepared and nervous.\n * Enter the room with a smile on your face and dress sharply.\n * Listen to every word the interviews say and be humble.\n * Gather information for the post you have applied for, the principles of the company, and the products they make.\nThese pointers will help you to behave in the exact manner that the interviews will expect from you and now, all that you have left to focus is on the technical aspect. For this purpose I suggest that you choose an online course which will provide you with a comprehensive knowledge and also refer to a book or two.\n\nCracking the Full Stack Developer Interview: The Complete Handbook Land the Job. by Hirako San AND Cracking the Coding Interview: 189 Programming Questions and Solutions. by Gayle Laakmann McDowell are two books that are widely suggested for interview purposes.\n\nSome of the questions that you can expect from these interview are -\n\n * To develop a project from scratch, what technologies and languages would you need or what skills a full stack developer should have?\n * Which language is the most preferred by full-stack developers?\n * Explain Pair Programming.\n * What do you mean by CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)?\n * What is Callback Hell?\n * Can you tell me what are the latest trends in Full Stack Development? Also, how do you keep yourself updated about the new trends in the industry?\n * What is CI (Continuous Integration)?\n * What are some of the uses of Docker?\nIn order to prepare for the technical knowledge aspect of the interview you should refer to the courses provided by Tutort Academy. Through this course you will be able to get 100% Placement Assistance after the completion of the course from the top professionals of the field.\n\nThis Placement Assistance is provided through -\n\n * Mock interview sessions\n * Resume review sessions\n * Profile building sessions, and\n * Job Referrals to the top companies.\nThe classes are taken in the form of live online sessions so as to provide a real-time interaction between students and mentors. And these classes can be taken from the comfort the students\u2019 homes so that they can focus solely on their studies rather than being exhausted by the travel to and from the institute.\n\nClasses are taken by experienced mentors from MAANG and other top-tech companies. There are also frequently held doubt clearing sessions so that the students are able to clear any and all doubts that they might have,\n\nA Small batch size of around 40 students helps to provide for a good learning environment where every student is able to get the required attention from the mentors and thus avoid any chaos. Other institutes have a batch size of 70+ students where there is a chaotic environment and students are not able to study in the best way possible.\n\nThere is also a special feature called the Flexible Pass which helps the students to cover up on any missed classes by accessing the live sessions of other batches, and providing them with a lifetime access to the course material which also includes the recordings of the sessions as well.\n\nIn order to learn more about the courses offered you should visit their official website where you will also be able to get a profile review from an expert.\n\nHOPE MY INFORMATION HELPED!

Define the job requirements: Before you begin the interview process, make sure you have a clear understanding of the job requirements and the technical skills required for the position. This will help you ask relevant questions and assess the candidate's knowledge and experience.\n2. Plan the interview questions: Create a list of interview questions that cover a range of topics related to Ruby on Rails. These questions should be designed to test the candidate's knowledge and experience with the framework, as well as their problem-solving and critical thinking skills.\n3. Use a whiteboard or coding challenge: One effective way to evaluate a candidate's technical skills is to use a whiteboard or coding challenge. This allows the candidate to demonstrate their coding skills and approach to problem-solving in real-time.\n4. Ask about relevant experience: Ask the candidate about their previous experience working with Ruby on Rails. This will help you assess their level of expertise and their ability to work on projects using the framework.\n5. Evaluate communication skills: In addition to technical skills, it's important to evaluate a candidate's communication skills. Look for candidates who can explain technical concepts clearly and concisely.\nAs for books to read to help you interview technical candidates for Ruby on Rails, \"Data Structures and Algorithms in Ruby\" by Hemant Jain is a good resource to learn more about the Ruby programming language and its data structures and algorithms.
