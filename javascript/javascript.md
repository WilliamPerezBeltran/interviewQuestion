## ¿what is react?

React is an open-source, front end, javascript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintanined by Facebook and a community of indibidual developers and companies.
React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.

React is a JavaScript library created for building fast and interactive user interfaces for web and mobile applications. It is an open-source, component-based, front-end library responsible only for the application’s view layer.

## ¿what is virtual DOM?

| sources                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [what-is-virtual-dom](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21965738/what-is-virtual-dom) |

###### First answer

The virual DOM is an in-memory representation of the real DOM elements generated by React components before any changes are made to the page .

It's a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen.
A component’s render method returns some markup, but it’s not the final HTML yet. It’s the in-memory representation of what will become real elements (this is step 1). Then that output will be transformed into real HTML, which is what gets displayed in the browser (This is step 2).

So why go through all this to generate a virtual DOM? Simple answer — This is what allows react to be fast. It does this by means of virtual DOM diffing. Comparing two virtual trees — old and new — and make only the necessary changes into the real DOM.

###### Second answer

VDOM is strategically to update DOM without redrawing all the nodes in a single page application.
VDOM is strategically to update DOM without redrawing all the nodes in a single page application. Finding a node in a tree structure is easy but the DOM tree for a SPA app can be drastically huge. Finding and updating a node/nodes in case of an event is not time efficient.
VDOM solves this problem by creating a high level abstraction of actual dom. The VDOM is a high level lightweight in-memory tree representation of actual DOM.

For example, consider adding a node in DOM; react keep a copy of VDOM in memory

1.  Create a VDOM with a new state
2.  Compare it with older VDOM using diffing.
3.  Update only different nodes in real DOM.
4.  Assign new VDOM as an older VDOM.

## what is JSX

| sources                                                                 |                                                                                   |

| [introduction-to-jsx](https://flaviocopes.com/jsx/#introduction-to-jsx) | [wikipedia-react](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)#JSX>) |

- JSX is an extension to Javascript syntax that allows you to insert HTML code. Using JSX we can create React elements easily.
- JSX code by itself cannot be read by the browser
- It must be transpiled into traditional JavaScript using tools like Babel and webpack

```
$ const myId = 'test'
$ const element = <h1 id={myId}>Hello, world!</h1>
```

**class** becomes className
**for** becomes htmlFor

Here’s a JSX snippet that wraps two components into a div tag:

```
<div>
  <BlogPostsList />
  <Sidebar />
</div>
```

## What can you tell me about JSX

When Facebook first released React to the world, they also introduced a new dialect of JavaScript called JSX that embeds raw HTML templates inside JavaScript code. JSX code by itself cannot be read by the browser; it must be transpiled into traditional JavaScript using tools like Babel and webpack. While many developers understandably have initial knee-jerk reactions against it, JSX (in tandem with ES2015) has become the defacto method of defining React components.

```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    let props = this.props;

    return (
      <div className="my-component">
        <a href={props.url}>{props.name}</a>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## what type of components exist in react

A component in React is an independent and reusable element. There are also two types of components in React:

Functional components: They only have properties.
Class components: They have properties, life cycles, and properties.

## What happens during the lifecycle of a React component

| sources                                                                                       |                                                                         |                                                                                     |                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

At the highest level, React components have lifecycle events that fall into three general categories:

- Initialization
- State/Property Updates
- Destruction

in other words

As everything goes through a cycle of taking **birth**, **growing**, and **death** the same goes with React.
Each component in React has a lifecycle that goes through three main phases **Mounting**, **Updating**, and **Unmounting**.

##### Mounting

The mounting means to put elements into the DOM. React uses virtual DOM to put all the elements into the memory. It has four built-in methods to mount a component namely

1. constructor()
2. static getDerivedStateFromProps()
3. render()
4. componentDidMount()

##### Updating

This is the second phase of the React lifecycle. A component is updated when there is a change in state and props React basically has five built-in methods that are called while updating the components.

1. getDerivedStateFromProps()
2. shouldComponentUpdate()
3. render()
4. getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
5. componentDidUpdate()

##### Unmounting

The final or the end of the react lifecycle is Unmounting. This is used when a component is removed from the DOM. React has only one built-in method that gets called when a component is unmounted

1. componentWillUnmount()

##### Summary

- The **constructor()** method is the best place to initialize our state
- The **getDerivedStateFromProps()** is a rarely used lifecycle method and is the best place to set the state object based on the initial props.
- The **shouldComponentUpdate()** specifies whether React should continue with the rendering or not.
- The **render()** method is the most used and compulsory lifecycle method.
- The **getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()** method has access to the props and state even after the update.
- The **componentDidMount()** is the most common and widely used lifecycle method and is called after the component is rendered. You can also use this method to call external data from the API.
- The **componentDidUpdate()** method is called after the component is updated in the DOM and is the best place in updating the DOM in response to the change of props and state.
- The **componentWillUnmount()** happens just before the component unmounts and is destroyed and is used for cleanup actions like canceling API calls.

## ¿What is a CallBack Function?

| sources                                                   |                                                                                |                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [callback](https://www.programiz.com/javascript/callback) | [javascript-callback](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-callback/) | [Callback_function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function) |

##### Definition

- A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.
- In javascript, a callback is a **function** passed into another function as an argument to be executed later.
- Callbacks are a way to make sure certain code doesn’t execute until other code has already finished execution.

In javascript, you can also pass a function as an argument to a function. This function that is passed as an argument inside of another function is called a callback function.

A function is a block of code that performs a certain task when called. For example,

```
// function
function greet(name) {
    console.log('Hi' + ' ' + name);
}

greet('Peter'); // Hi Peter

```

In the above program, a string value is passed as an argument to the greet() function.

In JavaScript, you can also pass a function as an argument to a function. This function that is passed as an argument inside of another function is called a callback function. For example,

```
// function
function greet(name, callback) {
    console.log('Hi' + ' ' + name);
    callback();
}

// callback function
function callMe() {
    console.log('I am callback function');
}

// passing function as an argument
greet('Peter', callMe);

```

```
Output

Hi Peter
I am callback function
```

## ¿What is an asynchronous operation?

| sources                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                       |                                                                                  |                                                                                             |

| [asynchronous-operations-in-javascript](https://dev.to/hebashakeel/asynchronous-operations-in-javascript-d16) | [synchronous-vs-asynchronous](https://dev.to/adrianmejias/synchronous-vs-asynchronous-programming-in-javascript-20o8) | [source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous) | [developers.google](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/async-functions) |

- **_Asynchronous means that things can happen independently of the main program flow_**.

JavaScript is synchronous by default, which means operations execute from top to bottom. Synchronous operations in JavaScript requires having each step of an operation wait for the previous step to execute completely. This means no matter how long the previous process takes, subsequent process won't start off until the prior is completed.

Asynchronous means that things can happen independently of the main program flow.
In Asynchronous operations, any process that takes a lot of time to process is usually run alongside other synchronous operation and completes in the future.
Let us see the fundamental concepts that JavaScript relies on to handle asynchronous operations.

## SYNCHRONOUS Tasks

| sources                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [source](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~dewan/242/s07/notes/ipc/node9.html) |

**What does synchronous means?** Say we have 2 lines of codes **Line-1** followed by **Line-2**. Synchronous means Line-2 can not start running until the Line-1 has finished executing.
**JavaScript is single-threaded**, which means only one statement is executed at a time.

##### What does synchronous work mean?

The word synchronous means working together at the same time, and in the online learning world, chat rooms and online conferences are good examples of synchronous communication. In a chat room, people's comments to each other are relayed immediately, enabling a real-time discourse.

> Synchronous: existing or occurring at the same time.

> Asynchronous: not existing or occurring at the same time.

## What is a Promise

| sources                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [developer-mozilla-promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises) |

A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
Essentially, a promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function.

Promises are one way to deal with asynchronous code, without writing too many callbacks in your code.

Promises simplify deferred and synchronous computations.
A promise represents an operation that hasn't completed yet.

##### Promises in JavaScript

First of all, a Promise is an object. There are 3 states of the Promise object:

1. **Pending**: Initial State, before the Promise succeeds or fails
2. **Resolved**: Completed Promise
3. **Rejected**: Failed Promise

| myPromise.state  | pending                                             | fulfilled         | rejected        |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| myPromise.result | undefined                                           | a result value    | an error object |
| which mean       | Initial State, before the Promise succeeds or fails | Completed Promise | Failed Promise  |

## Explain a Higher-Order Components

| sources                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [higher-order-components-react](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/06/higher-order-components-react/) |

Higher-order components is basically a function, which takes a component as a parameter and also returns a component.

1. **Higher-order components (HOCs) in React were inspired by higher-order functions in JavaScript**
2. A higher-order component (HCO) is an advanced technique in react for **reusing component logic**.
3. Is basically a function, which takes a component as a parameter and also returns a component.

> HOC basically incorpprate the don't-repeat-yourself (DRY) principle of programming. IT is one of the best -known principles of software development, and observing it is very important when building an application or writting code in general

In orden to understand higher order components is critical to understand higher-order function in javascript.

##### Higher-order functions in javascript

Higher-order functions in javscript take some functions as arguments and return another function.

##### Advantages:

1. Reduces bugs in our code
2. Makes our code much easier to read an undertand

##### Examples:

JavaScript has some of these functions already built in

> .forEach(), .map(), .reduce(), .filter()

Some examples of higher-order functions are the following:

##### AN EXAMPLE OF CUSTOM HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTION:

```
const formatCurrency = function(
    currencySymbol,
    decimalSeparator  ) {
    return function( value ) {
        const wholePart = Math.trunc( value / 100 );
        let fractionalPart = value % 100;
        if ( fractionalPart < 10 ) {
            fractionalPart = '0' + fractionalPart;
        }
        return `${currencySymbol}${wholePart}${decimalSeparator}${fractionalPart}`;
    }
}

```

**_formatCurrency_** returns a function with a fixed currency symbol and decimal separator.

```
> getLabel = formatCurrency( '$', '.' );

> getLabel( 1999 )
"$19.99" //formatted value

> getLabel( 2499 )
"$24.99" //formatted value

```

You might have noticed that we created a variable named **getLabel**, then assigned our **formatCurrency** higher-order function, and then passed the currency formatters to the function, which is the currency symbol and a decimal separator. To make use of the function, we call **getLabel**, which is now a function, and we pass in the value that needs to be formatted. That’s all! We have created a custom higher order of our choice.

##### What Is A Higher-Order Component

A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced element for reusing logic in React components. Components take one or more components as arguments, and return a new upgraded component.

##### FACTS ABOUT HOCS

1. We don’t modify or mutate components. We create new ones.
2. A HOC is used to compose components for code reuse.
3. A HOC is a pure function. It has no side effects, returning only a new component.

##### Here are some examples of real-world HOCs you might have come across:

| real-world HOCs | HOCs                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| react-redux     | connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(UserPage) |
| react-router    | withRouter(UserPage)                                   |
| material-ui     | withStyles(styles)(UserPage)                           |

##### Structure Of A Higher-Order Component

A HOC is structured like a higher-order function:

1. It is a component.
2. It takes another component as an argument.
3. Then, it returns a new component.
4. The component it returns can render the original component that was passed to it.

```

import React from 'react';
// Take in a component as argument WrappedComponent
const higherOrderComponent = (WrappedComponent) => {
// And return another component
  class HOC extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return <WrappedComponent />;
    }
  }
  return HOC;
};

```

> We can see that **higherOrderComponent** takes a component (**WrappedComponent**) and returns another component inside of it. With this technique, whenever we need to reuse a particular component’s logic for something, we can create a HOC out of that component and use it wherever we like.

##### Example Higher-Order Component

-

```
import React from 'react';

const Hello = ({ name }) =>
  <h1>
    Hello {name}!
  </h1>;

function withName(WrappedComponent) {
  return class extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return <WrappedComponent name="Smashing Magazine" {...this.props} />;
    }
  };
}
const NewComponent = withName(Hello);
const App = () =>
  <div>
    <NewComponent />
  </div>;

export default App;

```
