📌 My Interview Experience – Java Developer
I recently went through a Java Developer interview and thought it would be useful to share the questions I was asked.
 Hopefully this helps anyone else preparing for similar roles 🚀
💡 Technical Questions I got:
 1️⃣ Explain OOP concepts with examples.
 2️⃣ What are the new features in Java 8?
 3️⃣ How do you handle exceptions in Spring Boot?
 4️⃣ REST API design best practices.
 5️⃣ How do you manage communication between microservices?
 6️⃣ SQL query to fetch the 2nd highest salary.
 7️⃣ Scenario-based question on project migration.
 8️⃣ How do you secure microservices?
 9️⃣ Explain the concept of Multithreading.
 🔟 Difference between map and flatMap.
💡 My takeaways / tips:
 ✅ Revise your fundamentals (Java, Spring Boot, Microservices).
 ✅ Be prepared to explain your projects in detail – they dig deep.
 ✅ Practice SQL queries & basic coding challenges.
 ✅ Stay calm – you don’t need to know everything.
I really think sharing experiences makes the journey easier for everyone 🚀
 Curious to hear from you too – what kind of questions have you faced in interviews recently?
