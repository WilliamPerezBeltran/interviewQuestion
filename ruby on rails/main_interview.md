4. What are Rails migrations, and why are they important?  

### Routing and Controllers
5. How does the Rails router determine which controller action to execute?  
6. Explain how nested routes work in Rails and provide an example of when you might use them.  
7. What are strong parameters, and why are they used in Rails controllers?  
8. How would you handle a scenario where multiple controllers need to share common functionality?  

### Active Record and Database Management
9. How would you create a one-to-many relationship in Rails using Active Record?  
10. Explain the difference between `has_many :through` and `has_and_belongs_to_many`.  
11. What are scopes in Rails, and how can they improve query readability?  
12. How would you handle n+1 query problems in Rails?  

### Performance and Optimization
13. How would you optimize a Rails application with slow response times?  
14. Explain how Rails handles caching. Can you describe the difference between fragment caching and low-level caching?  
15. What is the role of the `eager_load` method in improving query performance?  

### Testing and Debugging
16. What are the different types of tests in Rails (unit, functional, integration), and how do they differ?  
17. How would you test a Rails model validation?  
18. Explain how the `byebug` gem can be used for debugging in Rails.  
19. How do you ensure the reliability of a Rails application when deploying new features?  

### Security
20. How does Rails protect against SQL injection?  
21. What are CSRF attacks, and how does Rails mitigate them?  
22. How would you secure sensitive user information (e.g., passwords) in a Rails application?  
23. What is the Rails `content_security_policy` and when would you use it?  

### Advanced Topics
24. What is a Rails Concern, and how does it help with code reusability?  
25. How does Rails handle background jobs? Can you name a gem or tool commonly used for this purpose?  
26. Explain the concept of polymorphic associations in Rails and provide an example.  
27. How would you use Rails with a non-relational database?  

### Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking
28. How would you design an API in Rails to handle a complex business process?  
29. Imagine you need to scale a Rails app to handle millions of users. What steps would you take?  
30. How would you integrate a third-party service (e.g., payment gateway, email service) into a Rails app?  
31. What strategies would you use to debug a failing Rails deployment?  

### General Best Practices
32. What are some best practices for organizing code in a Rails application?  
33. How do you handle code reviews and maintain coding standards in a team project?  
34. Can you explain the purpose of the Rails Asset Pipeline?  
35. How do you keep a Rails application up-to-date with the latest versions and security patches?
