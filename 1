	- The function of a modules is encapsules behaviour with diferentes elements in ruby for example with methods, classes or Constants.
	Also it provides a mechanism for multiple inheritance and the most import one is that the module it uses to reuse code.

* What is the differences between modules and class ? 
	-Modules is a block of code, with module we can not instance a module we extend it, require it. On the other hand a class is a blueprint to create objects.
  A class has differents features like attributes, instance methods, class methods and it is a important part of OOP (Object-oriented programming)

* What is the difference between extend and include ? 
include => Add the module's method as instance methods to the including class. it means that only when we instance the class to get a object we can get access to the method.
extend => Add the module's method as class methods to the including class.
